# User Onboarding and Offboarding Workflow

## Objective
Ensure secure and compliant management of user access through standardized onboarding and offboarding procedures.

## Governance Policies
- Access must be approved by the relevant manager.
- User accounts must comply with the organization's identity and access management policies.
- User privileges should follow the principle of least privilege.

## Onboarding Process
1. **Request Submission**
   - Manager submits a user access request via the designated ticketing system (e.g., ServiceNow).
2. **Approval Workflow**
   - Access request is reviewed and approved by the Security or IT Governance team.
3. **Account Creation**
   - IT/Admin creates user account in the relevant systems (e.g., Active Directory, cloud platforms).
   - Assign appropriate roles/privileges based on the user's role.
4. **Documentation & Audit Logging**
   - Record the onboarding details in a centralized log (e.g., Confluence, a version-controlled document).
   - Attach any approval documentation.
5. **Notification**
   - Notify the user of their account details and access guidelines.

## Offboarding Process
1. **Request Submission**
   - Manager submits an offboarding request when the user leaves or changes roles.
2. **Revocation & Deactivation**
   - IT/Admin disables the user account.
   - Revoke all associated access rights (email, VPN, cloud resources).
3. **Data & Asset Retrieval**
   - Collect any company assets or credentials.
4. **Documentation & Audit Logging**
   - Log the offboarding activity with date, reason, and reviewer.
5. **Audit & Compliance Check**
   - Ensure all steps are completed for compliance and audit purposes.
